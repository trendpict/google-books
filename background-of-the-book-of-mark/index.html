<p>John Mark who transcribed the teachings of Simon Peter is traditionally held to be the author of the Second Gospel. The Apostle Saint Mark was one of Christs 70 disciples one of the four evangelists and he author of the second Gospel The Book of Mark. For many years tradition held that the Gospel of Matthew was the first to be written and so when the canon of books was collected into the grouping that we now know as the New Testament Matthew was placed first in the order. In Mark many times Jesus exercises actions rather than words which would impress his Roman readers who the Book seems to be addressing. Mark was born in Cyrene Libya DOB unknown and died April 25th 68 AD in Alexandria Egypt. Google Ads Black Background Google Search Interesting Questions Book Of Life Question Mark.</p>
