Abandoning a Book Form by Kerri Trucano 1 150 Word Document File This form is used for when students want to abandon a book.

Its a questioner that is worded in a VERY SAD way for students to feel guilty about abandoning their book. The point of this form is to limit students from choosing not right books frequently. Books are typically unique in that they require a large investment of time. Next week well resume our book chats.
