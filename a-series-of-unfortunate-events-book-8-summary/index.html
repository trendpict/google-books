<p>A Series of Unfortunate Events is the story of the three Baudelaire orphans Violet Claus and Sunny. In Lemony Snickets eighth ghastly installment in A Series of Unfortunate Events Im sorry to say that the Baudelaire orphans will spend time in a hospital where they risk encountering a misleading newspaper headline unnecessary surgery an intercom system anesthesia heart-shaped balloons and some very startling news about a fire. My son read the complete A Series of Unfortunate Events books in 5th grade and loved themAt times he found them funny at times heartbreaking but always intriguing and he couldnt wait to turn the page or go on to the next. For A Series of Unfortunate Events. A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket Daniel Handler.
