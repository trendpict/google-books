<p>Elegantly charming artwork patterns and designs permeate the story of Disneys live-action film Beauty and the Beast. The fairy tale exists in numerous versions throughout the world. The original story of Beauty and the Beast was written by Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve. Its not quite as big or thick as the volumes published previously but its an excellent book about the art and making of Beauty and the Beast. After all of its ups and downs Disneys Beauty and the Beast was released in 1991 to rave reviews and record-breaking business. Pin On Walter Crane Princesses Royalty Free Illustrations.</p>

<p>Perfect for cultivating creativity relaxation and focus these pages are filled with artwork evocative of the beloved tale as old as time. Here we cast our minds back to the aristocratic salons of 17 th century France. 5 out of 5 stars. Elegantly charming artwork patterns and designs permeate the story of Disneys live-action film Beauty and the Beast. When I was able to read the tales themselves wove their spell so much so that over time the hardcover fell off and some pages from the last story The Goose Girl were lost.
