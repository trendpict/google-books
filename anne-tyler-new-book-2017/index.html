<p>Ive read a score of them now but this time Im reading Vinegar Girl to my mother who has Alzheimers. And without Pyotr his new scientific breakthrough will fall through. The incredible Pulitzer Prize winning novel is one of Ann Tylers master classes. The issue I felt was that it was a re-telling of The Taming of the Shrew which is not the most likable of Shakespeares plays and that storys flaws bled through into Tylers novel. With so many books releasing in 2021 and 2022 it can be difficult to track the newest Anne Tyler books and next Anne Tyler releases.
