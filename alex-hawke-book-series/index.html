I have to admit when I first started the book series I was not very impressed especially with the first book called Hawke. In Hawke the first book in the Alexander Hawke series Alex is introduced as a highly decorated naval hero from England on a mission to keep a powerful weapon out of the wrong hands. Bell was able to tap into the magic that made the Hawke series so. See the book on Amazon. Hawke By Ted Bell Alexander Hawke Is A Daring Dashing And Handsome Billionaire Adventurer Who Occasionally Does Fav Adventure Fiction Novels Nelson Demille.</p>

<p>Sea Hawke while not the best book in the series is a big improvement over the last few books. The Alex Hawke character first appeared in the novel Hawke and has most recently appeared in the novel Warlord which centers around the murder of Lord Mountbatten and a vendetta against the British Royal Family. Alexander Hawke is an exceptional individual and not only because he is a descendant of the legendary pirate Blackhawke. In this explosive jaw-tightening follow-up to Ted Bells rich spellbinding and absorbing Clive Cussler debut national bestseller Hawke fearless intelligence operative Lord Alexander Hawke matches wits with a cunning and bloodthirsty psychopath in a desperate race to avert an American Armageddon.
