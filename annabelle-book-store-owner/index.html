ANNABELLE by Ruby Jean Jensen is NOT based on the real Annabelle doll that resides in the Warrens museum. Another odd fact was that the paper used was parchment. A character based on the doll is one of the antagonists that appears in the Conjuring Universe. The true story of the original Annabelle doll began when she terrorized her first owner in 1970 forcing Ed and Lorraine Warren to take her to their Occult Museum for safekeeping.
