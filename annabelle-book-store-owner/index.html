<p>Annabelle is attracting huge numbers of people in to see it during its debut weekend many of whom are fans of The Conjuring and wanted to see the origins behind Annabelle the doll in the films. ANNABELLE by Ruby Jean Jensen is NOT based on the real Annabelle doll that resides in the Warrens museum. Another odd fact was that the paper used was parchment. A character based on the doll is one of the antagonists that appears in the Conjuring Universe. The true story of the original Annabelle doll began when she terrorized her first owner in 1970 forcing Ed and Lorraine Warren to take her to their Occult Museum for safekeeping.

Eventually both a crusty priest Tony Amendola and a sassy bookshop ownerdemon expert Alfre Woodard show up to help. This account relies heavily on the work of Gerald Brittle the author of the 1980 book The Demonologist in which the careers of the paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren was documented using the Warrens own case files and exclusive interviews with the authorIn its aftermath it appears that the names associated with the Annabelle case were changed or confused.
