<p>When he learned that Bernstein sometimes reviewed classical music he choked that down with difficulty. But the authors title is as misleading as many. The film opens on a triumphant President Nixon arriving at the Capitol to address a joint session of Congress. Moreover the sources used by the author were protected in order to seal their identity. Everyone knows how the story turns out. All The President S Men Sfmoma.</p>

<p>Political thrillers based on non-fiction books are oriented to represent the plot events extremely closely to reality. However the reality in All the Presidents Men 1976 is depicted vividly and completely and it is possible to speak about the successful representation of the documentary facts in the context of the highly artistic work. All the Presidents Men is a non-fiction book by journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein published in 1974. This is a story about dogged investigative journalism and about the workings of political power and about the nature of the men and women who crave and hold onto such power. Bernstein looked like one of those counterculture journalists that Woodward despised. All The President S Men Hoffman And Redford Fight The Powers That Be Culture The Guardian.</p>
