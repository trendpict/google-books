<p>I didnt feel that the climax was strong enough and it seemed over too quick. The economic crash is so brutal that even Ruthie feels it riding her bike past empty storefronts.

<p>A mother struggles to make a better life for her daughter. All We Had 2016 on IMDb. I enjoyed this book very much. Directed by Katie Holmes. This book had so much potential and i really liked the elders storytelling in the middle of the book but it didnt deliver as i had hoped.
