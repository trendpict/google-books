<p>There are a couple of aspects of Wonder that dont ring true. Wonder doesnt shy away from its bestselling source materials sentiment but this well-acted and overall winsome drama earns its tugs at the heartstrings. Wonder is one of those rare books that makes you want to hug everyone in it so tightly that theyll have no doubt about how much you love themand beyond that it also makes you want to reach out and hug the whole world. But Palacio gives weight to this important topic while keeping it light fun and realistic so that kids in older elementary and middle school will be pulled into the book and feel a part of Auggie Pullmans world.

<p>Palacio writes the book in multiple voices &ndash; Auggies some of his friends his sisters &ndash; and the different points of view are mostly very well-realized and show the inner feelings of the different characters. Throughout August is defined as not disabled He may look different horrifically so to some but as the book keeps insisting deep down he has the same abilities as his family and friends. Palacio is about a boy named August Pullman with Treacher Collins syndrome a condition that affected the formation of his face at birth. While I sobbed several times during Wonder my 9-year-old daughter who loved the book and has been pressing it on her friends remained dry-eyed. Whatever youre thinking its probably worse.
