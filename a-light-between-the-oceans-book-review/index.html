<p>The Light Between Oceans Book Review. The Light Between Oceansis exquisite and unforgettable a deeply moving novel I found this novel to be a fascinating read or rather listen The writing style is very descriptive but not as far as Tolkien descriptive rather more classical writing than dialogue writing. Based out of Australia this novel digs deep into the emotions of a couple that is isolated from the public eye trying to live a life full of love. It tells the story of war hero-turned-lighthouse keeper Tom and his young feisty wife Isabel on the tiny fictitious island of Janus Rock. The characters are compelling and this reader found herself wishing for a way to resolve the issue in the book in a way that would be satisfying to everyone involved.
