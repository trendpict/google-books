<p>Im a freelance writer living and working in Melbourne. In a narrative replete with poison arrows devouring snakes and a neighboring tribe of cannibals State of Wonder is a world unto itself where unlikely beauty stands beside unimaginable loss. This is a masterpiece of a novel about the awful price of love and the terror of its inevitable loss. State of Wonder is heavy with literary parallels to Henry James to Greek myth but in this respect the strongest links are to Heart of Darkness a novel that Patchett substantially rewrites. The book finally hits its jungle stride with long-toed birds water foliage as thick as lettuce and beneath its cover an anaconda worse than anything that ever made Marina wake up screaming.
