<p>I must say that I enjoyed it. Alice the book is very hard because it isnt really a story just a girl wandering from one weird situation to another. Alices Adventures in Wonderland is a familiar story of a girl named Alice that falls down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a nonsensical fantasy world inhabited by many colorful and peculiar creatures. There were somewhat of mixed reviews on this film. Price set by seller. Pin On What S On The Menu This Evening Sir.</p>
