A Long Petal of the Sea by Isabel Allende review love on the run from Franco A doctor and his brothers wife connect in exile in a sweeping story informed by real events. When I first saw Isabel Allendes new book A Long Petal of the Sea I thought it was one of the most beautiful titles Ive ever seen. In A Long Petal of the Sea no amount of summary pages and pages of historical and political background in which every conclusion feels foregone is enough to save the dialogue that. I thought I already knew about the Spanish Civil War 1936-39 thanks to all those English and American writers who went there to fight and wrote about it later.</p>

<p>A few passages coil toward melodrama and one inelegant line after a rape seems jarringly modern but the spell holds fast. My Review A Long Petal of the Sea is an incredible literary novel. Isabel Allende evokes these myths throughout her newest novel A Long Petal of the Sea which recounts the true story of the Dalmau family across the 20th century. The characters and plot lines are wonderfully crafted. A Long Petal of the Sea admirably translated from the Spanish by Nick Caister and Amanda Hopkinson is an agreeably old-fashioned novel.
