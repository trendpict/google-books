<p>Jeremiah receives Gods plan. 0000001815 00000 n 0000037146 00000 n He was born during an age of blessing and restoration as King Josiah reinstituted JEREMIAH also known as the weeping tender prophet. Jeremiah is wrestling with the question why is my life so hard. The book suggests that Baruch was the major editor of Jeremiahs prophecies and was probably the one who put the book into the form we know today as the Book of Jeremiah. The book of Jeremiah offers a three-fold thematic scheme that supports the central claim of the Pentateuch the claim found in Deuteronomy 64 and known to the Jews as the Shema a verse that declares the God of Israel is one true and living God.
