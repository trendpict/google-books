<p>The inspiration for a major motion picture starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley Alan Turing. Hodges book is excellent. The book was later made into the 2014 film The Imitation Game directed by Morten Tyldum starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing. The reader comes to know Turing as a witty charming physically passionate complex athletic emotionally nuanced and altogether captivating man at a singular remove from the stammering semi-autistic cartoon figure portrayed in the film adaptation of this truly remarkable biography. During his time and you may know this already he was one of the folks that cracked the enigma code. Pin On Agatha Awards.</p>
