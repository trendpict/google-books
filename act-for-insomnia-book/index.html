<p>Insomnia is all too common in our modern culture and can be devastating to your mental and physical health. ACT is about accepting the unwanted thoughts and behaviors associated with insomnia. It used to be very fragmented but now it has consolidated a lot which is better for me. Im afraid if I started using ACT again and going to bed and getting up when I did previous to my insomnia which was about 930 to 515 my sleep would become fragmented again and I would be very tired again. 9781409157618 from Amazons Book Store.
