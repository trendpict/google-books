<p>The adventures of eleven-year-old Adam as he travels the open roads of thirteenth-century England searching for his missing father a minstrel and his stolen red spaniel Nick. I use it with my 7 th and 8th grade class. A heartwarming story about the son of a traveling minstrel who is separated from his father and forced to live by his wits and music. Awarded the John Newbery Medal as the most distinguished. If youre a fan of road books or as theyre more fancifully called picaresques then ADAM OF THE ROAD should be in your to-be-read pile.
