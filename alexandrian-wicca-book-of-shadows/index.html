<p>Alexandrian Wicca or Alexandrian Witchcraft is a tradition of the Neopagan religion of Wicca founded by Alex Sanders who with his wife Maxine Sanders established the tradition in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. Alexandrian Book of Shadows Public Domain Version of the Alexandrian Book of Shadows by Sekhet Sophia 1990Founded by Alexander Sanders and his then wife Maxine the Alexandrian tradition is very similar to Gardnerian. Jessie Wicker Bell declared herself the leader of American witches and demanded that everyone hand over their Books of Shadows to her so that she could combine their contents and then establish a single authoritative Book of Shadows which all American witches would be expected to follow. Alexandrians are actually Gardnerians with an additional emphasis on ritual and ceremonial magick which I believe is what Gardner would have called High Magic Most of the Book of Shadows its liturgies and other materials are nearly identical for both Gardnerians and Alexandrians. A Book of Shadows is a book containing religious text and instructions for magical rituals found within the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Pin On Book Of Shadows.</p>

Alex Sanders claimed to have been initiated by his grandmother in 1933 and his tradition is somewhat more liberal than traditional Gardnerian Wicca. Alexandrian Wicca is similar in many ways to Gardnerian Wicca and receives regular mention in books on Wicca as one of the religions most widely recognized traditions. Different books of shadows are very different from each other as they bear the stamp. Covens of these traditions do not publish their Book of Shadows and only initiates of their Coven would have access to their Book of Shadows. Pin On The Weird.</p>
